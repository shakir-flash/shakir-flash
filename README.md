🌟 **Hi, I'm Shakir!** 🌟

Welcome to my GitHub corner, where data meets creativity! I'm a data science enthusiast currently based in San Jose, CA, juggling machine learning, quirky experiments, and the occasional caffeine overdose.

🚀 Here's a sneak peek into my world:

- **Fake Tweet Detective**: Using BERT and LSTM to bust fake tweets for disaster management. Twitter, you're on notice!  
- **Pac-Man Whisperer**: Teaching Pac-Man some serious decision-making skills with AI (because even Pac-Man needs a life coach).  
- **Stock Oracle**: Predicting Big Tech stock prices using neural networks. Spoiler alert: I'm not starting a hedge fund (yet).  
- **Napoleon’s March, Revamped**: Bringing historical data visualization back into style with ggplot2.  

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an **advanced chatbot** where you can communicate with an AI avatar of me—go ahead, ask it all about what I am!  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about **causal inference and its applications in predictive modeling** (turning causation into cool data insights).  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with **ML engineers** and work on innovations in **retail and healthcare sectors**.  
- 💬 Ask me about AI, machine learning, or my journey into creative problem-solving.  
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datasavvyshakir)  
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I was 12, my parents wouldn’t buy me a phone—so I entered a gaming contest, won, and got one **all by myself**.  

When I’m not training models or chasing data insights, you’ll probably find me exploring San Jose’s best coffee spots or plotting my next project idea. Feel free to drop by, star a repo, or just say hi. Let's build something awesome together! ✌️
